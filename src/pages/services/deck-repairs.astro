            <div class="prose prose-lg text-slate-600 mb-16">
                <p>
                    Living in Cowes or San Remo means your property is constantly exposed to salt-laden winds from Western Port Bay and the Bass Strait. This specific micro-climate causes unique problems for timber structures that generic handymen often miss.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most common issue we see is <strong>Galvanic Corrosion</strong>. This happens when standard galvanized screws are used. The salt air eats through the zinc coating, causing the screw to rust and snap. Once the fixing fails, your Merbau or Spotted Gum boards begin to cup and lift, creating a dangerous trip hazard.
                </p>
                <h3>Our Repair Protocol</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Structural Audit:</strong> We check your sub-floor bearers and joists for dry rot or termite damage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Board Replacement:</strong> We carefully remove rotten boards and source matching timber (Merbau, Spotted Gum, or Treated Pine).</li>
                    <li><strong>316 Stainless Upgrade:</strong> We re-screw loose boards using only 316 Marine Grade Stainless Steel screws. These are impervious to salt corrosion.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deep Cleaning:</strong> We use a high-pressure wash and specialized timber cleaner to strip back grey oxidation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Preservation:</strong> We apply two coats of Cutek Extreme CD50 penetrating oil. Unlike surface coatings that peel, Cutek soaks deep into the wood grain, stabilizing the timber and preventing water ingress.</li>
                </ol>

                            If you are <strong>replacing</strong> existing decking boards on a like-for-like basis, a building permit is generally not required. However, if you are extending the deck area or replacing structural members (bearers/joists), a permit may be triggered. We handle this assessment for you.

                            Many areas in Ventnor and Cape Woolamai have Bushfire Attack Level (BAL) ratings. This may strictly limit the type of timber you can use. We can upgrade your deck to BAL-compliant non-combustible materials if required.

                            <strong>Spotted Gum:</strong> Australian native, highly durable (Class 1). Very dense, requiring pre-drilling even for self-tapping screws.
