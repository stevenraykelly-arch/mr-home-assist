                    Buyers on Phillip Island are often looking for "move-in ready" holiday homes. Visible defects like peeling paint, mossy driveways, or jungle-like gardens signal "work required" and give buyers a reason to negotiate the price down.

                <p>
                    Mr Home Assist offers a "Market Ready" package designed specifically for Real Estate agents and vendors. We come in 2 weeks before photography to sort out the external appeal and internal niggles.

                            In coastal markets like San Remo, salt build-up on the facade can make a house look older than it is. A simple "soft wash" of the weatherboards and fascia can brighten the entire property without the cost of repainting.

                            We can help remove old outdoor furniture, rusted BBQs, or hard rubbish that has accumulated under the house, clearing the space for buyers to inspect the sub-floor area easily.
