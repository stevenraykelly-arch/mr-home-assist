# 1. Intake & Definition

**Objective**: Define the core identity and requirements of the new website.

## Steps

1.  **Questionnaire**: Ask the user for the following details if not already provided:
    -   **Business Name** (e.g., "Phillip Island Plumbing")
    -   **Service Area** (e.g., "Cowes, San Remo")
    -   **Primary Service** (e.g., "Emergency Plumbing")
    -   **Contact Phone**
    -   **Target Audience** (e.g., "Holiday Home Owners")

2.  **Documentation**:
    -   Update `directives/master_design_prompt.md` with these details.
    -   Ensure the "Business Name" is distinct enough to be a unique Project Name (e.g., "Phillip Island Plumbing" vs "Plumber").

3.  **Checkpoint**:
    -   [ ] `master_design_prompt.md` is updated.
    -   [ ] User has confirmed the details.

**Next Step**: Proceed to `2_research.md`.
